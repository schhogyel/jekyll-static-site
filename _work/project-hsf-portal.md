I was responsible for developing the site ground up to the specifications provided by the client. Starting
from theme development to site building, the page templates and some custom modules were
developed . Issues and tickets were handled in JIRA. 

Agile (SCRUM) was the preferred development
methodology treating each features request from the client as a story. Taxonomy was heavily deployed
for document categorization.

 Contextual filter and relationship in views was used to serve individual
documents with details of the documents. User login and requesting access were customized to clients
requirement. Sub theme based on Omega 4 (Drupal contributed theme) was developed to the specification.
