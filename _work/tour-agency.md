I was involved in full site development with custom theme development based on Bootstrap framework. Tour websites deploy large image banners and form api and preprocess functions were used to customize forms. 

JQuery plugins and scripts used to enhance user interaction and experience. Form API was used to modify and change custom forms. The layout was accomplished by panels.
