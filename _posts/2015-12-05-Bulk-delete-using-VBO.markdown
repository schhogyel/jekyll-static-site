When there are thousands of contents to be modified, edited or deleted, it becomes frustrating tasks. Views Bulk Operation Module works on top of Views module for executing bulk operation.

<p>Example: Delete massive contents or nodes in Drupal?</p>


<ol>
<li>Download and Enable <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/views_bulk_operations">Views Bulk Operation (VBO) module</a> . </li>
<li>Create a new view with table of fields and apply filters for the nodes that you want to delete.</li>
<li>Add a VBO field and in the settings select options to delete.</li>
<li>Go the that page that you have created with views and click on Select all</li>
<li>Click on delete all options. All nodes will be deleted subsequently. It is that easy.</li>

</ol>
